## **Course Overview**
This program is tailored for advanced learners who want to apply **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques in finance. 
The course spans multiple disciplines, including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and NLP, focusing on their application in financial markets to improve trading and investment decisions.

By the end of the program, you will have hands-on experience building AI-powered trading systems and will be equipped to deploy these strategies in real-world financial markets.


## **Prerequisites**
- A solid understanding of financial markets and investment principles.
- Proficiency in Python programming.
- Experience with machine learning frameworks like **scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**.
- Familiarity with handling financial datasets and time series data.


## **Course Structure**

### **Module 1: Foundations of AI in Finance**
In this module, you'll focus on the basics of using machine learning for financial data, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

#### **Assignments (Module 1)**
- Download financial data and apply feature engineering.
- Build a **Random Forest** model for stock price prediction.
- Use **K-Means Clustering** to segment stocks.


### **Module 2: Deep Learning and NLP in Finance**
This module covers advanced techniques like deep learning and natural language processing for financial forecasting and sentiment analysis.

#### **Assignments (Module 2)**
- Build and fine-tune an **LSTM** model for time series forecasting.
- Use **BERT** for sentiment analysis on financial news.


### **Module 3: Reinforcement Learning and Automated Trading**
You'll dive into reinforcement learning to develop automated trading strategies that learn from market data.

#### **Assignments (Module 3)**
- Develop a **Q-Learning** agent to optimize trading actions.
- Build a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to enhance trade execution strategies.


### **Module 4: Portfolio Optimization and Risk Management**
This module focuses on optimizing portfolios using genetic algorithms and managing risk using AI-based techniques.

#### **Assignments (Module 4)**
- Use **Genetic Algorithms** to optimize asset allocation.
- Build a machine learning model to adjust portfolio risk dynamically.


### **Module 5: Advanced AI for Trading Systems**
This module covers advanced AI techniques to build sophisticated, fully automated trading systems capable of adapting to market changes in real time.

- **Advanced Deep Learning Techniques**: Explore cutting-edge architectures like **Transformers** and **GANs** (Generative Adversarial Networks) for financial forecasting. Learn how transformers can be used for sequential prediction tasks and how GANs can generate synthetic financial data for model testing.
  
- **AI-Driven Trading Systems**: Develop complex trading systems that combine multiple AI models (ensemble learning), integrate external data (such as news feeds and social media), and perform real-time decision-making.

- **Risk Control Mechanisms**: Learn to incorporate AI-based risk control mechanisms into trading systems. You will build automated systems that monitor the market for anomalies or high-risk conditions and adjust trading strategies accordingly.

#### **Assignments (Module 5)**
1. Implement a **Transformer-based** model for financial time series prediction.
2. Use **GANs** to generate synthetic financial data for model training and testing.
3. Develop an AI-driven trading system that integrates **ensemble learning** for enhanced decision-making and real-time trading actions.


### **Capstone Project: Algorithmic Trading Strategy**
The course culminates in a **Capstone Project**, where you'll build an end-to-end **Algorithmic Trading System** that incorporates the techniques learned throughout the course.

#### **Capstone Requirements**
- **Prediction Model**: Implement a deep learning or machine learning model (e.g., **LSTM** or **Transformer**) for predicting stock prices or market movements.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Develop an RL-based agent to make trading decisions and automate trade executions.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Apply **Genetic Algorithms** or **Deep Reinforcement Learning** to optimize your portfolio's asset allocation.
- **Risk Management**: Integrate AI-based risk management tools into your trading system for automatic adjustments during market volatility.
  
Deliver a comprehensive report with backtesting results, performance metrics (e.g., **Sharpe ratio**, **maximum drawdown**), and trading logs.
